## Research Interests

I am interested in developing **recommendation systems** that not only capture but actively
elicit users' latent intentions throughout their interaction history. My research focuses on
leveraging multimodal signals to more clearly reveal and represent these hidden preferences,
ultimately enabling more accurate and explainable recommender models.

In parallel, I also work on **multimodal retrieval**, aiming to represent the intrinsic
characteristics of each modality and align them effectively so that a user's query can be
matched with the most relevant document.

## Education

## Experience

### Intern, Query-Rewrite Team, Naver (Bundang, Korea)

**Jul 2024 – Aug 2024**

- Trained and evaluated a BERT-based embedding model to improve relevance between user
  keyword-based queries and internal documents.
- Designed prompts and generated augmentation data using large language models (HyperCLOVA,
  LLaMA 3.1 405B) to address embedding model weaknesses.
- Improved retrieval robustness by incorporating LLM-generated hard cases into the data pipeline.

### Coach, Boostcourse Coaching Study, Generative AI (ModuLABS | Naver Connect)

**Sep 2024 – Nov 2024**

- Reviewed participants' code and projects using generative AI tools and provided detailed
  technical feedback.
- Diagnosed implementation issues and advised on optimization strategies for model performance and
  generation quality.
