I am Ph.D student at [Data Intelligence (DI) Lab](https://di.postech.ac.kr/di/index.do) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), advised by [Prof. Hwanjo Yu](https://di.postech.ac.kr/di/mem/professor.do).

I'm interested in developing **recommendation systems** that not only capture but actively
elicit users' latent intentions throughout their interaction history.
My research focuses on leveraging multimodal signals to more clearly reveal and represent these hidden preferences,
ultimately enabling more accurate and explainable recommender models.

In parallel, I also work on **multimodal retrieval**, aiming to represent the intrinsic
characteristics of each modality and align them effectively so that a user's query can be
matched with the most relevant document.
